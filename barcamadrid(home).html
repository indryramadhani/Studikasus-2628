                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî The football world was once again captivated by <b>El Cl√°sico</b>, the eternal battle between <b>FC Barcelona</b> and <b>Real Madrid</b>. On <u>May 11, 2025</u>, these two giants delivered a seven-goal thriller, with <b>Barcelona</b> triumphing 4‚Äì3 in front of a roaring home crowd in Catalonia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The match had everything ‚Äî goals, drama, a hat-trick from <b>Kylian Mbapp√©</b>, a comeback story, and tactical fireworks. With the <b>La Liga</b> title race in full swing, this game was more than just a derby ‚Äî it was a potential title decider.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>‚û§ Early Domination by Real Madrid</b> <br>
                The visitors struck first blood just five minutes into the match. A reckless tackle inside the box gifted Kylian Mbapp√© a penalty, which he converted calmly. Not long after, in the 14th minute, Mbapp√© doubled the lead with a blistering counterattack, finishing past Barcelona‚Äôs goalkeeper with clinical precision.

            <p>
               <b>‚û§ Barcelona's Counterpunch</b> <br>
                Despite being 2‚Äì0 down, Barcelona didn't back down. The midfield trio of Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, and G√ºndoƒüan began to dictate the tempo. Their efforts paid off in the 19th minute, when Eric Garc√≠a rose high to head in a corner from G√ºndoƒüan, bringing the score to 2‚Äì1.

                As the pressure mounted, Raphinha stepped up. He scored twice ‚Äî once in the 32nd minute with a curling effort from outside the box and again just before halftime following a defensive error by Madrid‚Äôs backline. The first half ended 3‚Äì2 in favor of the hosts.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>‚û§ Madrid's Hope Through Mbapp√©</b> <br>
                In the 70th minute, Mbapp√© completed his hat-trick ‚Äî a superb solo goal that left three defenders behind. His third goal brought the match level at 3‚Äì3 and reignited Real Madrid‚Äôs hopes.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
               <b>‚û§ Yamal‚Äôs Winner</b> <br>
                As the match approached its closing stages, Lamine Yamal, Barcelona‚Äôs 17-year-old prodigy, became the unlikely hero. In the 83rd minute, after a clever one-two with Jo√£o F√©lix, he slotted the ball past Courtois to make it 4‚Äì3. The stadium erupted.
