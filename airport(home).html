                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî Passengers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced major disruptions on May 11, 2025, as over 200 flights were delayed due to a combination of technical issues and staffing shortages. The chaos affected both domestic and international routes, leaving travelers stranded for hours and creating a ripple effect across other U.S. airports.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), delays were caused by a temporary malfunction in the airport‚Äôs air traffic control system, which occurred during one of the busiest travel periods of the spring season. In addition, airline representatives reported that insufficient ground staff contributed to the problem, causing further delays in check-ins and baggage handling.

               Many passengers voiced their frustration on social media, with some reporting that they were stuck on the tarmac for more than two hours. Airlines have apologized for the inconvenience and are offering rebooking options and travel vouchers to affected travelers.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                The airport authority confirmed that normal operations resumed later in the evening, but warned travelers to expect residual delays over the next 24 hours. Transportation officials said they are conducting a full investigation and will implement improvements to prevent similar disruptions in the future.
