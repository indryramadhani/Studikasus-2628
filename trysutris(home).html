                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî <b><i>Former Vice President General (ret.)</i> Try Sutrisno</b> admitted that he agreed with the declaration of the <b>Retired TNI Soldiers Forum</b> demanding the impeachment of <b><i>Vice President</i> Gibran Rakabuming Raka.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, <b>Try</b> said he also signed the declaration. The reason is, he considered the actions of the retirees as an effort to save the nation. He emphasized that all <b>TNI</b> retirees from various branches are united, including police retirees. According to Try, they want the country to be reorganized.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>You see the contents. Those are all the main issues. Those are all serious issues. If you, the Indonesian people, read that, if this is not resolved, the country will be destroyed,</q> <b>Try Sutrisno</b> told Tempo at his residence in <i>Menteng, Central Jakarta, on Thursday, May 1, 2025.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Try Sutrisno</b> admitted that he not only discussed with the retired officers, but also accommodated aspirations from civil society. He asked the public to ask constitutional law experts whether <b>Gibran</b>'s nomination violated because it forced age to be nominated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>It will definitely be heard by people, the public. Not just retirees. If it's good, we'll be quiet, we won't talk,</q> he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <u>April 17</u>, the <b>TNI Retired Soldiers Forum</b> read out a statement of position towards the <b>Prabowo Subianto</b> government. There were eight points of position, one of which was to remove <b>Gibran</b> as vice president.
            </p>
            <p>
                The eight points of demand were signed by 103 retired generals, 73 admirals, 65 marshals, 91 colonels, and were directly acknowledged by former vice president Try Sutrisno.
            </p>
            <p>
                Responding to the demands, Special Advisor to the President for Politics and Security General TNI (ret.) Wiranto said Prabowo understood the eight points of demands submitted by the TNI retired forum. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Prabowo could not immediately provide an answer because he had to study the demands which were considered not a trivial matter, but fundamental.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wiranto also said that Prabowo also could not respond to the demands to impeach Gibran because it was outside the president's authority. "We cannot interfere with each other there. Proposals that are not in his field, the president's domain, of course will not be responded to," said Wiranto at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, Thursday, April 24, 2025.
