                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî Global oil prices fell by more than 1% on Friday, following a decision by OPEC+ to increase oil production quotas in the coming months. The move came as part of the group's effort to balance supply and demand dynamics amidst a fragile global economic recovery and unpredictable geopolitical tensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                OPEC+, which includes the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, announced a moderate output hike after lengthy deliberations. The group stated that increasing output was necessary to stabilize the market and prevent a supply squeeze that could hurt energy-importing countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, energy analysts warned that this decision may result in short-term oversupply, especially as economic slowdowns in China and Europe have dampened demand forecasts. Investors responded swiftly, leading to a drop in Brent crude and WTI futures by over 1% during early trading hours.

            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                Consumers may benefit from lower fuel prices, but some oil-producing nations expressed concern about revenue losses if prices fall further. Market watchers will continue to monitor global demand trends and geopolitical developments‚Äîparticularly tensions in the Middle East‚Äîthat could reverse the current price trajectory.
