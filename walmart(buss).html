                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî Walmart Inc., the world‚Äôs largest retailer, has announced it will increase prices on a wide range of products in the United States, citing the continued impact of U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite reporting strong quarterly profits, the company said that increased operational and sourcing costs driven by these tariffs have left it with no choice but to pass some of the burden onto consumers.

                Among the products affected are everyday essentials such as fresh produce, household goods, and children's car seats. The move comes as tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, even after some were temporarily reduced. Walmart‚Äôs CFO, John David Rainey, noted that while the company has tried to absorb these costs, the long-term strain has forced them to act to preserve profitability.

                The decision has attracted criticism, notably from former President Donald Trump, who called on Walmart to ‚Äúabsorb the tariffs‚Äù instead of pushing the costs onto American families. Meanwhile, former Walmart CEO Bill Simon pointed out that the retailer‚Äôs improved margins should allow it to manage the situation more delicately.

            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                Walmart‚Äôs pricing strategy will be closely watched by economists and competitors, as it could signal broader inflationary effects across the retail sector.
