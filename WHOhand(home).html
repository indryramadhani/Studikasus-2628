                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî On May 5, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) once again championed the cause of proper hand hygiene as it observed World Hand Hygiene Day. With the slogan ‚ÄúClean Hands Are Life-Saving Hands,‚Äù WHO is urging both individuals and institutions to prioritize regular handwashing as a frontline defense against infectious diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year‚Äôs campaign comes amid growing concerns over rising antibiotic resistance, global outbreaks of seasonal illnesses, and persistent gaps in basic hygiene infrastructure in many parts of the world. WHO officials emphasized that simple actions, such as washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, can drastically reduce the transmission of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.
            </p>
            <p>
               In healthcare settings, hand hygiene remains a critical component of infection prevention. WHO has provided updated guidelines for healthcare workers, emphasizing the "Five Moments for Hand Hygiene" and encouraging greater adherence to sanitation standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond hospitals, schools and community organizations are also playing a vital role in spreading awareness. Campaigns are taking place in classrooms, public restrooms, and on social media to reinforce the message that clean hands save lives.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                Dr. Maria Kowalski, a spokesperson for WHO, stated:
                <br>
                ‚ÄúHand hygiene is not just about cleanliness‚Äîit‚Äôs about protection, dignity, and health. Especially after recent public health crises, we cannot afford to be complacent. It starts with soap, water, and a commitment to good habits.‚Äù
