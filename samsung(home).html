                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî In a bold move that is sending waves through the tech community, Samsung Electronics has officially begun its teaser campaign for its next-generation flagship devices: the Galaxy Triple-Fold and the Galaxy S25 Edge.

                The Triple-Fold, as the name suggests, introduces a three-panel design that folds into a compact smartphone and unfolds into a full-sized tablet. This versatile device is set to redefine multitasking, with users able to run multiple apps simultaneously across different screens. Early prototypes hint at an ultra-thin design, high refresh rate AMOLED panels, and a seamless hinge mechanism built for durability.

               Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Edge offers refined aesthetics and cutting-edge hardware. With a curved-edge display, the device integrates AI-driven features that enhance productivity, gaming, and mobile photography. Enhanced camera capabilities, a faster processor, and deeper integration with Samsung‚Äôs ecosystem (including wearables and smart devices) make it one of the most anticipated releases of the year.

                Tech analysts predict that these models will help Samsung solidify its lead in the foldable device market, especially as competitors like Apple and Huawei explore their own foldable concepts.
