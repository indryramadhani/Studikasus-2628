                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî The Indonesian football scene is abuzz with debate as Liga 1, the country‚Äôs top professional football league, considers a major shift in its foreign player policy for the upcoming 2025‚Äì2026 season. The proposal, currently under review by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and Liga 1 operators, would increase the number of foreign players allowed per club ‚Äî a decision that could reshape the league‚Äôs future.
            </p>
            <p>
               Under the proposed regulation, clubs would be permitted to register up to 8 foreign players (up from the current 6). This would consist of: 5 non-Asian foreign players, 1 player from another Asian Football Confederation (AFC) member, 2 additional foreign players (any origin) as backups
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                Out of these, a maximum of 6 foreign players could be fielded per match, while the rest could remain on the bench or be rotated. This expansion, if passed, would be one of the most liberal foreign player quotas in Southeast Asia ‚Äî aligning Indonesia with leagues like Saudi Pro League or the Chinese Super League, both of which have embraced foreign talent as a means to increase competitiveness and commercial visibility.
