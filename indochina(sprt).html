                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî The stage is set for one of the most anticipated matches in Southeast Asian football this year. Indonesia will face China on June 5, 2025, at the iconic Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta as part of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. Tickets for this crucial match officially went on sale today, with high demand from fans across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The match could prove to be decisive in determining who progresses to the third round of qualification for the 2026 World Cup, jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. With both teams currently neck-and-neck in the Group C standings, the encounter in Jakarta carries enormous weight.
            </p>
            <p>
               This approach is part of a strategic partnership between PSSI and Bank Mandiri, aiming to ensure a smoother, more secure ticketing process. Organizers have warned that tickets are selling fast, and fans are encouraged to buy early to avoid disappointment.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                China arrives in Jakarta with a squad undergoing transition. While still relying on experienced stars like Wu Lei and Ai Kesen (Elkeson), the team is also experimenting with new youth players as they aim for their second-ever World Cup appearance (first and only in 2002).
                <br>
                China‚Äôs football federation has invested heavily in youth academies and foreign coaches, making this team technically strong and well-disciplined.
                <br>
                However, Indonesia‚Äôs home advantage and recent momentum could be the difference.
