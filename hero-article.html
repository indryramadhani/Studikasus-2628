                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî The <b>US</b> and <b>China</b> both pointed to progress after high-stakes trade talks over the weekend, with both sides building optimism of further deescalation from a tariff tit-for-tat that has roiled global markets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who led the talks for the US delegation, said there was <i>"substantial progress"</i> over the weekend, promising more details Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
              <q> I'm happy to report that we've made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,</q> Bessent told reporters in Geneva.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng called the talks<i>"an important first step."</i>  <b>President Trump</b> had posted late Saturday: <q>GREAT PROGRESS MADE!</q> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Trump</b> came into the weekend suggesting the <b>US</b> could consider slashing its tariffs on <b>China's</b> goods. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Optimism for a shift in <b>US</b> policy grew last week as <b>Trump</b> announced a trade deal with the UK, the first for his administration since imposing ‚Äî then pausing ‚Äî sweeping <i>"reciprocal"</i> tariffs against all trading partners in early April. He said Friday that the US had <i>"many trade deals in the hopper."</i>  
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Trump</b> said the <i>"breakthrough"</i> <b>US-UK</b> trade agreement would boost <b>US</b> export markets for agricultural products, including beef and ethanol.
            </p>
            <p>
                As top <b>US</b> officials, including Bessent, get set to meet with <b>Chinese</b> counterparts this weekend, <b>Trump</b> has suggested he might meet with <b>Chinese President Xi</b>  after the initial talks.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the economic front, <b>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell</b> emphasized on Wednesday that while sentiment has deteriorated, the tariff "shock hasn't hit yet" as the central bank held interest rates steady.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scale of tariff disruption on the economy will largely depend on how quickly trade deals are reached. After meeting with <b>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney</b> on Tuesday, <b>Trump</b> reiterated that the onus to make offers falls on other countries.

                <q>We don't have to sign deals,</q>
                 he said at the White House. <q>They have to sign deals with us.</q>
