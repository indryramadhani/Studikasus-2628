                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî Bangkok, Thailand ‚Äì The 2025 Thailand Open officially kicked off on May 13 at the Nimibutr Stadium in Bangkok, drawing elite shuttlers from around the world for one of the most anticipated badminton tournaments in Southeast Asia. As a BWF World Tour Super 500 event, the tournament not only offers substantial prize money and ranking points, but also plays a critical role in determining the qualification standings for the Paris 2026 Olympics.

                This year, Indonesia has sent 29 players, with at least 10 top representatives spotlighted as medal contenders across five categories: Men's Singles (MS), Women's Singles (WS), Men's Doubles (MD), Women's Doubles (WD), and Mixed Doubles (XD). These players are not only competing for individual glory, but also carrying the nation‚Äôs hopes for Olympic success and maintaining Indonesia's reputation as a badminton powerhouse.

               The Thailand Open 2025 comes at a crucial time in the Olympic qualifying calendar, where every ranking point earned could mean the difference between making the cut or missing out on the Summer Games. According to the BWF‚Äôs Olympic Qualification System, points accumulated from January 2024 until April 2025 will determine which athletes qualify.

            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                Players ranked inside the top 16 (for singles) and top 8 (for doubles pairs) are almost assured of a spot, but competition is fierce. For Indonesian players, performing well here is a strategic objective, especially in the face of rising competition from countries like Japan, China, India, and Korea.
