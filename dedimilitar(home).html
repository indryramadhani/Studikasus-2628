                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî <b><i>West Java Governor</i> Dedi Mulyadi </b>launched a program to develop troubled students through <i>military-style</i> education starting on <u>May 2, 2025</u>. This program aims to discipline students involved in juvenile delinquency, such as brawls, skipping school, and minor criminal acts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program involves several areas in West Java, including: <b>Purwakarta</b>: A total of <b>39</b> junior high school students have been sent to military barracks to take part in a coaching program. <b>Bandung City</b>: A total of <b>30</b> junior high and high school students are taking part in a similar program. <b>Depok, Bogor, Cianjur, Garut, Tasikmalaya, Cimahi City, and Sukabumi</b>: These areas have also sent students to military barracks as part of the coaching program.
            </p>
            <p>
               The program is conducted at various military facilities across <b>West Java</b>, such as the <b>Kostrad Regiment 1</b> in <b>Purwakarta</b> and the <b>Rindam III/Siliwangi</b>. Students will undergo training for a period ranging from 14 days to six months, depending on individual needs and evaluations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students receive a mix of physical, mental, and academic education, including: <b>Nationalism and state defense, Military-style discipline and marching drills, Anti-drug education and religious instruction, Daily academic lessons aligned with the school curriculum (around 2 hours per day).</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The program has sparked mixed reactions. Some see it as a bold solution to youth delinquency, while others express concern over potential human rights violations and the risk of militarizing civilian education.
