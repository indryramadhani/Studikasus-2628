                <b id="tittle-article">BULETIN NEWS</b> ‚Äî The armed conflict between <b>Russia</b>and <b>Ukraine</b> that has been going on since <u>February 2022</u> has again shown a major escalation. On a <u>Sunday night in mid-May 2025</u>, <b>Russia</b> launched the largest drone attack since the beginning of the invasion. A total of <b>273</b> kamikaze drones were launched into various regions of <b>Ukraine</b>, with the main focus on the capital, <b>Kyiv</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drones used in the attack were the Shahed, an <i>Iranian-made</i> kamikaze drone that <b>Russia</b> has used in previous attacks. But the number launched this time broke the record for airstrikes since the war began.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attacks targeted civilian facilities, energy infrastructure, and residential areas in and around <b>Kyiv</b>. Initial reports indicate: <b>(1) 88 drones were shot down by Ukrainian air defense systems, (2)Another 128 drones disappeared from radar and likely reached their targets or were not detected, (3)The attacks killed one person, and injured three others, including a 4-year-old child.</b> Explosions occurred in several residential districts, causing damage to residential homes and local power grids.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Ukraine</b> claims that its air defense systems have successfully intercepted most of the drones. However, the massive scale of the attacks has put a strain on existing defense systems. The <b>Ukrainian</b> government has stated that it needs more air defense assistance from partner countries such as the <b>United States</b> and the <b>European Union</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Ukraine</b>'s Defense Minister said, <q>This is not just an attack on <b>Ukraine</b>, but on the entire <b>European</b> security order. <b>Russia</b> is testing our resilience.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>
                The international community, including <b>NATO</b> and the <b>European Union</b>, strongly condemned the attack. Countries including <b>Germany</b>, <b>France</b> and the <b>UK</b> called for additional sanctions on <b>Russia</b> and increased military and humanitarian support for <b>Ukraine</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="hero-bottom-article">
                The UN also expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for an end to attacks on civilian infrastructure.
